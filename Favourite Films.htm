<H2><B>1.Avengers Endgame</B></H2>
<IMG SRC="Avengers Endgame.jpg">
<H2><B>Reason</B></H2>
<H4><B>Due to alot of reasons, Avengers Endgame is my favourite film of all time due to its ability to make watchers feel such extreme emotions
and making a great conclusion to a 10 year movie franchise and becoming the highest grossing film of all time beating out such films as: Avatar,
Titanic,Star Wars The Force Awakens, Jurassic Park ect.</B></H4>

<H2><B>2.Guardians Of The Galaxy</B></H2>
<IMG SRC="Guardians Of The Galaxy.jpg">
<H2><B>Reason</B></H2>
<H4><B>Guardians of the galaxy was one of the first films i ever watched where I truly felt it deserved a place in this list and my insticts were
correct!The films were a massive success of course not doing as well of the other films on the list but was very well recieved which has caued 
Marvel to make a third film coming out from 2020-2023.

<H2><B>3.Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back</B></H2>
<IMG SRC="Star Wars Empire.jpg" HEIGHT="1328" WIDTH="1355">
<H2><B>Reason</B></H2>
<H4><B>Now, who doesn't love these films. This one paricular because it gives an interesting turn on Star Wars and strays from the regular
"heroes always win" cliche which I think gives this film alot of personality and sentiment.
<H2><B>About</H4></B>
<H4><B>Star Wars the empire strikes back is a space sci fi thriller in which the main character trains under a grand master as the rest flee from 
an imperial feet eventually landing in a space city and match up with their greatest foe causing the main character to postpone his training
and rush to save them.</H4></B>
<H2><B>4.The Lego Movie</B></H2>
<IMG SRC="Lego Movie.jpg" HEIGHT="1328" WIDTH="1355">
<H2><B>Reason</B></H2>
<H4><B>This film holds a special place in my heart for doing something nobody thought would work and pulling that thing off perfectly and I
think is a great example that a dumb improbable idea can still work.
<H2><B>About</B></H2>
<H4><B>The Lego movie is a movie in which the main character dicovers he is "the special" (the only being capable of stopping a looming end)
and works together with several master builders to stop their enemy.
